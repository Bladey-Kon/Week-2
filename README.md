Week 2 Assignment 
Create a new GitHub repository as described in the git workflow on the Resources page.
Inside your repository, add the following:
The starter files (download and extract them to your repository directory).
A README.md file that explains what this repository is.
Open the script.js file and edit the file to satisfy the requirements. Write your code below each comment in the file that explains each programming task.
Write code to output the following string to the console: "Hello World!"
Write code to concatenate three strings and output the result to the console: "Hello", " ", "World!"
Write code to output "Hello" on one line and "World!" on the next line to the console.
Note: You should only have one console.log() statement - how do you add a new line in a string?...
Write code to output the result of the arithmetic expression to the console: 3 * 8 + 2; 
Write code to output the result of the comparison: 5 is less than 10.
Write code to output the result of the comparison: 10 is greater than 5.
Write code to output the result of the comparison: "Apples" is NOT equal to "Oranges"
Write code to output the result of the comparison: 10 * 10 is greater than 50 AND 5 * 5 is less than 50
Write code to output the result of the comparison: 1 + 2 is greater than 5 OR 1 * 10 is greater than 5
Write code that demonstrates an automatic type conversion as shown in Chapter 01.
You must make your changes iteratively and create git commits between any major changes.
Submit the URL for your GitHub repository. Make sure that the URL works before you submit it!
